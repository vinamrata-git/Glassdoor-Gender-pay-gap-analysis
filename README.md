# Glassdoor-gender-pay-gap-analysis
In this project I have done only exploratory data analysis i.e. tried to visualize all the columns and showed the impact on pay-gap between male and female by different kind of graphs.

# insights
1. there are some jobs where females are paid very less in comparison of male like software engineers and more 
2. female get paid more the male in marketing Associate positions 
3. female get paid equal to male at data scientist positions
